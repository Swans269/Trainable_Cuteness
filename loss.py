    Pair loss isn't quite enough usually. There is a way out of that loss 
    function, and that is to rank everything exactly the same. So to mitigate 
    this, we can force the net to maintain a certain spread of ranking results 
    with another loss function. Standard deviation seems to work fairly well, 
    although the beta distribution loss can be used to try to approximate a 
    top-heavy training distribution. In my implementation the top of the ranks 
    are preferentially sampled in order to fine-tune on only the things I care 
    about, but to be honest standard deviation loss is still what I use most of 
    the time anyway. Suprisingly, it is still possible to do SGD, except in our 
    case the example is actually a minibatch of size 2. I've found the standard 
    deviation loss still works, although training isn't quite as stable.
